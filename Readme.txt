In this project I am using Machine Learning pretrained model "YoLo v3" to detect the objects in an image. The dataset used is coco dataset which has 80 different labelled data.

I used PyQt designer application to create a GUI.
Note: convert the .ui format to .py as py format is faster to compile. 
for this use: pyuic5 design.ui -o design.py

Please install yolo v3 weights to run this model.
